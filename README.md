xbmc-controller-keymap-template
===============================

Wanna use an unsupported controller in XBMC? It's a pain to create the keymap so this project is a template to help you create your own.

Instructions:
1. Download ps3_controller_keymap_template.xml and follow the instructions.
2. Optionally download ps3-controller-global-keymaps.jpg for a diagram of button mappings.
